    "Q1. How does bagging reduce overfitting in decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble technique that involves training multiple instances of the same base model on different subsets of the training data. In the context of decision trees, bagging helps reduce overfitting through the following mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap Sampling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging involves creating multiple bootstrap samples by randomly selecting subsets of the training data with replacement.\n",
    "Each bootstrap sample is used to train a separate decision tree.\n",
    "The randomness introduced by bootstrap sampling ensures that each tree is exposed to a slightly different subset of the data, reducing the likelihood of overfitting to specific patterns in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorrelation of Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each tree in the bagging ensemble is trained on a different subset of the data, the resulting trees are somewhat decorrelated.\n",
    "Overfitting in one tree is less likely to be replicated in others because they are exposed to different variations of the data.\n",
    "The ensemble's prediction, obtained by averaging or voting, combines the strengths of individual trees while mitigating their weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Averaging Predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "For regression tasks, the final prediction in a bagging ensemble is often the average of the predictions made by individual trees.\n",
    "For classification tasks, the final prediction is determined by a majority vote among the individual trees.\n",
    "Averaging the predictions helps smooth out overly complex decision boundaries, reducing the risk of capturing noise or outliers present in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Generalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "The ensemble's ability to generalize well to unseen data is enhanced as each tree in the bagging ensemble contributes a different perspective on the problem.\n",
    "The diversity of the trees allows the ensemble to capture the underlying patterns in the data more robustly, leading to improved generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Robustness to Noisy Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging can increase the robustness of the ensemble to noisy or outlier instances in the training data.\n",
    "Since individual trees might make errors on certain instances, the ensemble's aggregate decision is less likely to be influenced by isolated instances that do not represent the overall patterns."
